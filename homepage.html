				<p class="title">Luncheon Boating Party</p>
				<p class="artist">Pierre Auguste Renoir</p>
				<p>
					The painting depicts a group of Renoir's friends relaxing on a balcony at the Maison Fournaise along the Seine river in Chatou, France. In this painting Renoir has captured a great deal of light. The main focus of light is coming from the large opening in the balcony, beside the large singleted man in the hat. The singlets of both men in the foreground and the table-cloth all work together to reflect this light and send it through the whole composition.

					<em>The Kiss</em> (original <em>Der Kuss</em>) was painted by Gustav Klimt, and is probably his most famous workAccording to writer Frank Whitford: "Together the man and the woman form the shape of a penis and I think that is intentional - it's about sex and about the fulfillment of sex between a man and a woman."

				<p class="title">The Basket of Apples</p>
				<p class="artist">Paul Cezanne</h4>
				<p>
					<em>The Basket of Apples</em> is a still life oil painting noted for its disjointed perspective. It has been described as a balanced composition due to its unbalanced parts; the tilted bottle, the incline of the basket, and the foreshortened lines of the cookies meshing with the lines of the tablecloth. Additionally, the right side of the tabletop is not in the same plane as the left side, as if the image simultaneously reflects two viewpoints. Paintings such as this helped form a bridge between Impressionism and Cubism.
